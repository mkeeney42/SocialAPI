# Social API

## Description
This project is a Social Network API designed to facilitate interactions among users, allowing them to share thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and manage friendships. Built with Express.js and MongoDB, the API supports various functionalities essential for a social networking platform, including user management, thought sharing, and reaction handling.

## Technologies Used
Node.js: For building the server-side application.
Express.js: For routing and handling requests.
MongoDB: NoSQL database to store user and thought data.
Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB to manage schema and data modeling.
